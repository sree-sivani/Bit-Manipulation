# Bit-Manipulation

Welcome to the **Bit-Manipulation** repository! This project focuses on fundamental bit manipulation operations implemented in Java.

## Overview

Bit manipulation is a crucial aspect of low-level programming, enabling efficient data processing and optimization. This repository provides Java implementations of basic bit manipulation techniques, serving as a resource for understanding and applying these operations in various programming scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following Java files, each demonstrating a specific bit manipulation operation:

- **`GetBit.java`** – Retrieves the value of a specific bit at a given position.
- **`SetBit.java`** – Sets a bit at a particular position to 1.
- **`ClearBit.java`** – Clears (sets to 0) a bit at a specific position.
- **`UpdateBit.java`** – Updates a bit at a given position to a desired value (0 or 1).

Each file includes a main method with example usage and test cases to demonstrate the functionality.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the bit manipulation examples:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sree-sivani/Bit-Manipulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Bit-Manipulation
   ```

3. **Compile and run the desired Java program**:

   ```bash
   javac GetBit.java
   java GetBit
   ```

   Replace `GetBit` with the name of the Java file you wish to execute.
